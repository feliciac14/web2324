    <h3>I've learned a lot this year</h3>
    <ul>A few things that I've learned are:</ul>
    <li>How to read patterns</li>
    <li>Different stitches</li>
    <li>How to make cables, with and without a cable needle!</li>
    <li>The power of blocking!</li>
    <li>Continental vs. English knitting</li>
    <p>Pictured to the left is a part of my folklore cardigan. I'm making it based off of the "Folklore Cardigan" knitting pattern by Lion brand. This cardigan has taught me a lot. I learned how to adjust a pattern to my measurements from it, which was a little scary, but blocking is a savior! I learned how to knit cables with a cable needle at first, but then I learned how to knit cables without a cable needle. I learned about moss stitch, garter stitch, all of that good stuff!</p>
