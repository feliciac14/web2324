        <summary>A v-neck sweater vest</summary>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">This was NOT it. It fit very baggy and not in a good way... it was a trash bag silhouette. It was my first experience knitting ever, so it holds a special place in my heart. For some reason my tension was so good? I was onto something that I'm no longer on. I love the yarn though, so I'm planning on scrapping it to make the Boat Neck Top by nelsknits. This might take a while because I'm currently taking a break from knitting, the folklore cardigan drained me.</p>

        <summary>Leg warmers</summary>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Why??? Why did I make these? I used this black and grey yarn from the Makerspace and knitted two small tubes. Firstly, I rarely wear skirts/dresses. Secondly, the legwarmers didn't keep my legs warm! They are now lying forgotten in the back of a cabinet. Thin, poorly seamed tubes of knit. I can't express my disgust and hatred for them enough.</p>

        <summary>Folklore cardigan</summary>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">THIS WAS IT! I spent the majority of 2023 working on this cardigan and it is so beautiful! The cables, the moss stitch, the ribbing with black stripes! Chef's kiss! I am not exactly a Swiftie, but the design of her cardigan is pretty cool. TO THE TAYLOR FANS READING THIS, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdmhiv7O5m8" target="_blank">video</a> on her that you should watch. It's highly interesting and enlightening! Neocapitalism! Poptism vs. Rockism! The Beatles! This is my favorite knit of 2023. My favorite knit ever!</p>
